# Tamil Handwriting Recognition Detection Model

**Tamil AI / Tamil Artificial Intelligence**

This project aims to detect handwritten letters of the Tamil language (a South Indian Language) using deep learning neural networks, specifically TensorFlow/AI. The current implementation utilizes the Inception V3 model (`inception_v3`).

The sample training data is originally sourced from the following website:
- [Tamil Handwritten Character Recognition (IWFHR-06)](http://shiftleft.com/mirrors/www.hpl.hp.com/india/research/penhw-resources/tamil-iwfhr06-train.html)

You can download the original images from the following link:
- [HPL Tamil IWFHR-06 Train Offline Dataset](http://shiftleft.com/mirrors/www.hpl.hp.com/india/research/penhw-resources/hpl-tamil-iwfhr06-train-offline.tar.gz)

Please note that not all the images have been converted in the current version.

To better understand the deep learning aspect, the following document was referenced:

## Getting Started

Before proceeding with the project, ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites and follow the provided steps:

### Prerequisites

- Anaconda: Make sure you have Anaconda installed for Python 3.5+. You can download it from the official website: [Anaconda Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

### Create and Activate TensorFlow Environment

You can choose one of the following methods to create and activate the TensorFlow environment:

#### Method 1: Using Anaconda

Follow the instructions provided by TensorFlow for installing TensorFlow using Anaconda: [Installing TensorFlow with Anaconda](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows#installing_with_anaconda)

#### Method 2: Using Command Prompt

Alternatively, you can create and activate the TensorFlow environment using the following commands in Command Prompt:

```shell
C:> conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
C:> activate tensorflow
(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow
```

### Validate Installation

To validate your installation, run the following command in the command prompt, using the provided `test.py` file:

```shell
(tensorflow)C:> python test.py
```

## Usage

Follow the steps below to train and utilize the Tamil Handwriting Recognition Detection Model:

### Step 1: Clone the Project

Clone this project to a local folder and navigate to that folder.

### Step 2: Extract Images

Unzip the `160x160.zip` file in the `Training Data/Tamil/160x160/` folder. Make sure to remove all the zip files from that folder. If desired, you can also use the "Tamil Font to Handwriting Image" project to generate more images.

### Step 3: Activate TensorFlow

Open the Command Prompt (`Start -> Run -> CMD`) and execute the following command to activate the TensorFlow environment:

```shell
C:> activate tensorflow
```

### Step 4: Training Your Data for 160x160 Image Size

Initiate the training process by executing the following command:

```shell
(tensorflow)C:> python -m retrain --how_many_training_steps=6000
```

Increasing the number of training steps (`how_many_training_steps`) generally leads to better accuracy of the results.

### Step 5: Validate Your Own Handwritten Tamil Letter

Validate the model's performance by testing it with your own 160x160 image or by using a

 sample image from the `Test_Images/160` folder. Run the following command:

```shell
(tensorflow)C:> python label_image.py --test_data_dir=Test_Images/160
```

## Problem Statement

The current implementation of Handwritten Equation Recognizer has several situational problems. It is not purely based on machine learning, which prevents it from leveraging the processing power available in today's machines. Furthermore, there is insufficient data to accurately predict the characters extracted from the input images. Conventional methods of computing equations also require extensive manual input, which can be cumbersome and prone to user errors, especially for complex problems. This can lead to discrepancies and errors in the obtained data, particularly in fields where accuracy is crucial. The Handwriting Equation Recognizer project aims to address these issues by significantly reducing the manual input required.

## Presentation

A presentation on this project was prepared during our 2nd year. You can find the PowerPoint presentation in the [presentation folder](./presentation).
